[introduction]
= Introduction

Banking service is a RESTful microservice for managing user accounts, deposit and withdraw money.

[overview]
= Overview
Banking service provides only client specific functionality.
All resources are secured with authentication except <<Creating new user, creating new user>> request.
Secured resources can be accessible using Basic authorization (username (email) and Password) or using x-auth-token request header.
On successful Basic authorization x-auth-token will be exposed in response headers for further use, instead of
using your credentials every time.

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs
Service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update existing resource

|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes
Service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
The actual response will depend on the request method used.
In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.
In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

| `201 Created`
| The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
